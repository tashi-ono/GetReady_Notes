# Big O

## What is it?

- General measure of

1. Time complexity
   - 'Consistent' time is O(1)
   - 1 represents the number of operations in your algo
   - There can be more than 1, but we say 1 for simplicity
   - Consistent time is not necessarily the fastest time
2. Space complexity

## Definitions

1. O(1): Constant
2. O(N): Linear
3. O(N<sup>2</sup>): Quadratic
4. O(log N): Logarithmic - this is the fastest as the data set gets larger (the more the logarithmic graph-line levels out horizontally)
5. O(N log N)
6. O(N!): N factorial - this is the devil!!!!

## Binary Search

- Data set must already be sorted
- Divide and conquer technique
- Given a target number, divide data in half
- If center number is higher or lower than target number, then discard the half of the data set that your target doesn't lie in.
- Can eliminate halves recursively with each iteration

## Merge Sort

- Divide data set in half
- Then recursively divide each subset in half until you have single elements
- Then sort the single elements in each subset until all subsets are merged back together

## Bubble Sort

- Bubbles are at the bottom then come to the top of a soda
- As you iterate over elements, you compare current element with the next element and swap lowest element to be on top (in a tree) or to the left (in an array), then move to the next element after swap
- Will have to continue swapping until all elements are properly sorted as they may not be on the first iteration
